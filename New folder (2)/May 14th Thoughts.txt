	Its almost like, something is keeping me down. And I believe it to be women that I don't fancy. I also believe it to be men that do not have any common ground with me. I really try not to think about it that often. It irks me that I cannot get any attention from women. I am usually one to not complain, but Its starting to get weird. I still stick to what I believe, and I know I will get what I desire, but I have a feeling that my desire is overdue. I get that women need someone with money, but will anyone spare me just one time? I promise to give the world to them.

	It seems like I still take things personally(who doesn't?), but I realize, that to reach a higher echelon, then you need to not take things personally. I also want to dabble on the topic of humility. I've been humiliated all throughout K-12, not necessarily by women, which is what I believe to be the problem. Why wont they come at me then? I'm not going to react in a dangerous or hurtful way. I just wish they would believe me.
