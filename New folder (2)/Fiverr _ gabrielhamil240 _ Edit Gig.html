What should I do?","original_gig_includes_a":"Before custom translations were available, some sellers used multiple languages for their original Gig. Now that we have the right framework to translate your Gig, we recommend that you keep your original Gig in a single language, and manage translations through the Additional Languages tab. Please note: You are welcome to translate your Gig here without making any changes to the original.","should_i_q":"Should I keep the translation literal or can I add local flavor?","should_i_a":"Translations are always a mix of art and science. You should aim to keep your Gig content as identical to the source language as possible, but if a literal translation sounds funny or incorrect, you should tweak it to make it as attractive as possible to local audiences. Gigs should not offer differing terms or services  in different languages.","can_i_change_q":"Can I change the prices of my Gig for local audiences?","can_i_change_a":"No. Your Gig prices are set on the original Gig page, and will stay consistent across all languages.","can_i_use_q":"Can I use machine translation in order to translate my Gig?","can_i_use_a":"This feature is designed for Sellers to provide high-quality Gig translations in other languages they actually speak.
