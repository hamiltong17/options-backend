I am 25 years old from New Jersey, I enjoy staying active, managing my finances, venture capital, business, marketing, and advertising. I am keen on building and troubleshooting computers, and am proficient with Apple's macOS. I am currently assisting my father with his bicycles sales & repair business. Currently we are utilizing the WIX platform, with its integrated SEO features, to better market and drive more customers to the business. I am open to work in any of the position that is available, but would prefer to work in the Web Design position. I am very ambitious, and have a very creative collaborative mindset. I am adamant that I would be a great asset to your team.
