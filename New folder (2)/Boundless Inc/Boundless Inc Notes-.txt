	Rebuttle
	- I get that solar used to cost 40,000, and that was way too expensive

	(Facts/Solutions)-But the now the federal government is funding companies like us so we can provide you with solar at no upfront cost. all you have to do is pay a cheaper bill next month.

(I have No Money CLOSE)-I have technicians in the area all day today and tommorrow who can show you exactly how much money you will save on your electricity, down to the penny and answer any questions you may have. Does today or tommorrow work better for you?

	"I dont like solar panels, they are ugly"

		(Empathize/Relate/Build)-I know exactly what you mean, your talking about those big bulky boxes with silver frames and silver lines going through them. Ive seen some pretty bad installations in the area.

		(Provide Solution)-Here at boundless we just use sleek jet black panels along with a railess racking system. This allows the panels to lay flat on the roof, almost likes its "inlaid"

		(Engage Convo)-Have you ever seen an ad for Boundless? Other companies spend millions of dollars on advertisment. We would rather invest in our employees. Every home we install is a billboard for us and no one likes and ugly billboard.



"Yea ok, nothing is really free..."

(Empathize/Relate/Build)-Your absoultely right, and neither is your electric bill. You pay taxes right? You and yout neighbors tax dollars get funneled into different programs like FASFA, healthcare and the renewable energy program.

(Provide Solution) -So if you qualify, then you get to take advantage of the NJ Solar Program, and you will recieve money back.

we just wanted to let you know where your money is going

"Im moving in a few years"

(Empathize/Relate/Build)- Oh wow thats great, where are you relocating? Im sure that you know that most homeowners spend thousands of dollars renovating their homes to maximize its value.

(Give Facts)- Solar is the most COST-EFFICIENT solution to do that. Lets say your home and an identical home both go up for sale and one has a cheaper cost of living. Which would you choose? Of course the one with a cheaper cost of living. Studies show that homes with solar will sell up to 25% faster.


(CLOSE)- I have technicians in the area all day today and tommorrow who can show you exactly how to build equity into your home.

"My Roof is Old"

Empathize Relate Build- "I understand, I know it an be very expensive and time consuming to replace your roof."

Provide Solution- "At boundless we work with local roofers and might be able to include a new roof into your project, while still saving you money on your electric bill every month. Our main goal is to qualify you for solar."

(CLOSE) - I have technicians in the area all day today and tomorrow who can explain how our roofing program work and we can answer any questions that you may have.
